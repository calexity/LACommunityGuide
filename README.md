## LA Community Guide

We think it should be easier to find the community resources you need around Los Angeles. We're working on making an easier to search list but for now, we offer you [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18C6ICLQMYb59r7jXbIYdpuBAGGbji3yoGDXW4N9W4FU/edit?usp=sharing). 

Share these resources with your neighbors and make sure people are getting what they need. 

This list currently includes:

- Groceries and Free Food
- Meals
- Transportation
- Showers
- Laundry
- Storage
- Access Points and Access Centers
- Substance Abuse Programs
- Mental Health Programs
