## LA Community Guide

We wanted a simple to search resource list for LA neighborhoods. Share these resources with your neighbors and make sure people are getting what they need. This list currently includes

- Groceries and Free Food
- Meals
- Transportation
- Showers
- Laundry
- Storage
- Access Points and Access Centers
- Substance Abuse Programs
- Mental Health Programs

See something that needs updating? Want to add a new program? [https://github.com/calexity/LACommunityGuide/issues/new/choose](Open an issue) or email us at [mailto:team@LACommunityGuide.com](team@LACommunityGuide.com)

_This list is maintained by Emily Uyeda Kantrim and Lex Roman_
